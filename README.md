# Icarus Harness Java Scaffold

![BOOMKALAKASHA watermark](docs/assets/brand/watermark-auto.svg)

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md) · [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) · [Support](SUPPORT.md)

**Architecture harness:** safe Java project generation plus a source/test
reference map, one durable task contract and runnable, versioned verification.
Both profiles include the first engineering loop; see [Harness](docs/harness.md).
The coding host owns implementation and scheduling. Existing CLI/REST and
Maven coordinates remain compatible after the repository rename.

From one confirmed service request, Icarus uses its CLI or REST adapter to
generate a consistent Java 17 / Spring Boot starting point that a team or
collaborating agents can inspect, build, test, and evolve. The Scaffold does
not include or host an AI model and does not interpret open-ended natural
language; a Vibe Coding tool or IDEA plugin may help turn a conversation into
the confirmed CLI or REST request.

`Icarus-harness-java-scaffold` is a security-focused, host-friendly generator for
small Spring Boot projects. It validates the project coordinates and writes a
ZIP archive in memory before returning it. The generated project is intended as
a reviewable starting point for a Java 17 / Spring Boot 3 application; it is
not a hosted service or a deployment guarantee.

The repository itself is released under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

## At a glance

| If you need to... | Icarus gives you... | A useful first result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start a new Java service | A validated, multi-module Spring Boot project ZIP or a compact simple-profile ZIP | A reviewable skeleton instead of an empty repository |
| Keep generation safe | Bounded coordinates, confined paths, ZIP traversal checks and no-overwrite output | A predictable artifact that is safer to hand to a team or Agent |
| Choose how to integrate it | A local CLI plus an optional REST adapter | A scriptable path for developers, CI jobs or a trusted internal edge |
| Prove the generated project is usable | Package, health, greeting and optional Docker Compose checks | Evidence about the sample, with unavailable checks reported as `NOT_RUN` |
| Continue architecture optimization | Context references, approved-scope steps, pending-answer gate and fixed local build verifier | A recoverable engineering loop with source/build evidence kept separate from acceptance |

Typical uses include bootstrapping a small Spring service, creating a consistent
starting point for several collaborating Agents, or demonstrating a service
shape in a workshop. It is a generator and reviewable starting point—not a
replacement for application-specific design, security review or deployment
operations.

## Quick start (60 seconds)

No global Maven installation is required for the first run: use the checked-in
wrapper and keep the generated ZIP in the current directory.

For a first try, follow these four steps:

1. Build the reactor so the CLI and its dependencies are available locally.
2. Generate `demo-service.zip` with the CLI command below. The example uses
   the simple profile so a small service starts with one Maven module.
3. Unpack it and read the generated `AGENTS.md`, README and module layout
   before changing application code.
4. Run `python scripts/generate-sample.py --root .` when you want package,
   runtime and (if available) Docker evidence for the generated project.

The default CLI mode still writes byte-compatible ZIP output to stdout; use
`--output` when a new file in the current directory is more convenient.

Choose the path that matches your use case:

| You want to... | Start with... |
| --- | --- |
| Generate locally or in CI | The CLI and its `--output` option |
| Let a trusted internal tool request a ZIP | The optional REST adapter |
| Verify the complete sample path | `python scripts/generate-sample.py --root .` |

The commands below build this checkout. For published artifacts, start from
the latest GitHub Release and use the jar name matching that immutable tag.

POSIX shell:

```bash
./mvnw -B -ntp clean verify
java -jar icarus-scaffold-cli/target/icarus-scaffold-cli-1.2.0-all.jar \
  --artifact demo-service --group com.example.demo \
  --package com.example.demo --port 18080 \
  --description "Generated sample" --profile simple --output demo-service.zip
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd -B -ntp clean verify
java -jar .\icarus-scaffold-cli\target\icarus-scaffold-cli-1.2.0-all.jar `
  --artifact demo-service --group com.example.demo `
  --package com.example.demo --port 18080 `
  --description "Generated sample" --profile simple --output demo-service.zip
```

`--output` accepts only one new `*.zip` filename directly below the current
working directory. Absolute, nested, `..`, non-ZIP and existing targets are
rejected; `CREATE_NEW` protects against a validation/write race. Omit it to
preserve the original stdout ZIP contract.

## Choose an architecture profile

The CLI and REST request share the same two profile values:

| Profile | Generated shape | Choose it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `simple` | One Maven module with domain, application, infrastructure, API and boot packages | You want the shortest path to a small working service |
| `modular` | Five Maven modules with the same greeting and health slice | Those layers need independent build or ownership boundaries |

The modular profile remains the default when the profile is omitted, keeping
backwards-compatible output.
The `simple` command above is a reproducible no-AI entry point: after the CLI
is built, it does not require an AI service or a hosted Scaffold endpoint. The
CLI does not include or host an AI model.

## What you get

**Illustrative generated result — paths and responses below describe the
bundled sample contract, not a deployed service:**

The tree below illustrates the modular profile; a simple-profile ZIP keeps the
same package boundaries under `src/` and has one root Maven module.

```text
demo-service/
├── AGENTS.md
├── pom.xml
├── domain/
├── application/
├── infrastructure/
├── api/
└── boot/
```

```http
GET /api/greetings?subject=team
200 {"subject":"team","message":"Hello, team!"}

GET /actuator/health
200 {"status":"UP"}
```

By default the ZIP has no `LICENSE`. Add `--license`,
`--copyright-holder`, and `--copyright-year` together when the actual
rights holder has made that decision; supported identifiers are
`Apache-2.0` and `MIT`.

## What is here

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `icarus-scaffold-core` | Input validation, FreeMarker rendering, safe paths and ZIP generation. It has no web or database requirement. |
| `icarus-scaffold-cli` | Local command-line entry point that writes a generated ZIP; it does not overwrite an arbitrary directory. |
| `icarus-scaffold-server` | Optional REST adapter. It returns a ZIP, applies request limits and security headers, and does not accept a server filesystem path. |
| `icarus-scaffold-core/.../templates/` | The generated multi-module project and its public development documentation. |

Template selection is a trusted extension point. `--template-pack` and the
REST `templatePack` field default to `default`. The stock registry contains
only that bundled pack; trusted downstream applications can add
`TemplatePack` implementations from the process classpath and configure an
explicit REST allow-list. Pack manifests contain only safe relative logical
template/output paths. Template directories, arbitrary filesystem paths, URLs,
shell commands and runtime external JAR paths are not accepted.

The generator deliberately keeps the core independent from HTTP and database
concerns. Generated projects contain the application layers and tests needed
for a useful starting point, but each generated project still needs normal
dependency, security, operational and license review before production use.

## Companion projects

- [AI-first Vibe Coding Skill](https://github.com/boomkalakasha/ai-first-vibe-coding-skill) — take the generated service from a clean skeleton through bounded agent implementation, independent review, and evidence-backed acceptance.
- [Icarus Open-source Governance](https://github.com/boomkalakasha/icarus-open-source-governance-skill) — prepare the service for public release with provenance, privacy, documentation, and release-evidence checks.

## Requirements

- JDK 17 (a Temurin or other compatible OpenJDK distribution is suitable).
- Maven 3.9+ or the checked-in Maven wrapper when available.
- Python 3.10+ for the repository verification scripts.
- Docker and Compose are optional and are only needed when validating a
  generated project's container files.

All build dependencies are expected to resolve from Maven Central. No private
repository, private binary or organization-specific service is required by
the public build.

## Build and test

```bash
./mvnw -B -ntp clean verify
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p "test_*.py"
```

On Windows PowerShell, the equivalent is:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd -B -ntp clean verify
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p "test_*.py"
```

The default GitHub workflow builds the full Maven reactor and runs tests. It
then generates a sample project, builds and tests that sample, and runs the
public-content scanner over the source and generated material.

## Generate a ZIP locally

The CLI writes ZIP bytes to standard output by default. When using an
executable CLI artifact that includes its runtime dependencies, redirect that
output to a file when you need a destination outside the cwd filename policy:

```bash
java -jar icarus-scaffold-cli/target/icarus-scaffold-cli-1.2.0-all.jar \
  --artifact demo-service \
  --group com.example.demo \
  --package com.example.demo \
  --port 18080 \
  --description "Generated sample" > demo-service.zip
```

The exact jar filename includes the project version. Run the CLI's help
command if an option has changed in a later compatible release. The safer
in-process path is `--output demo-service.zip` shown above. The command does
not accept an arbitrary output directory, overwrite switch, template
directory, shell command or server filesystem path.

To select the bundled pack explicitly, add `--template-pack default`. Unknown
pack IDs fail before ZIP output. The optional REST adapter uses the same
`templatePack` request field and allows only IDs in
`icarus.scaffold.allowed-template-packs` (default: `default`). Configure more
than one trusted ID as a comma-separated value such as `default,company-java`.

For a platform-neutral end-to-end check, run:

```bash
python scripts/generate-sample.py --root .
```

The script locates the CLI jar, validates ZIP entry paths, extracts the sample
into a temporary/generated verification directory and runs Maven `package` in
the generated project. It then starts the packaged app for bounded health and
greeting checks. Docker Compose parsing, image build and container-health
checks run only when Docker and Compose are available; otherwise the report
records `NOT_RUN`. Temporary apps, containers, Compose-owned local images, and
verification directories are cleaned up. A cold Docker cache gets a 600-second
build window by default; set `ICARUS_DOCKER_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to a positive
number of seconds when a runner needs a different bound. Set
`ICARUS_CLI_ARGS_JSON` to a JSON array of CLI options if a downstream-compatible
CLI needs a different argument layout; the ZIP still must be written to stdout.

## Run the optional REST adapter

```bash
java -jar icarus-scaffold-server/target/icarus-scaffold-server-1.2.0.jar
curl --fail-with-body -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"artifact":"demo-service","group":"com.example.demo","package":"com.example.demo","port":18080,"description":"Demo service","profile":"simple"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/scaffolds --output demo-service.zip
```

The server accepts JSON only, rejects unknown fields, returns `application/zip`,
and never accepts an output directory or overwrite instruction. It binds to
`127.0.0.1` by default. If you deliberately expose it on a network, set
`SERVER_ADDRESS` and add authentication, rate limiting, TLS and operator-level
monitoring at your trusted edge; this repository is not a turnkey public
multi-tenant service.

## Security boundaries

Inputs such as artifact, group, package, port and description are bounded and
validated. Optional license, copyright holder, and year values are atomic and
bounded; the generator rejects partial declarations instead of guessing
ownership. Template paths are normalized and must remain under a temporary
root; ZIP entries cannot be absolute or contain parent traversal. The public
generator does not accept shell commands, arbitrary template directories,
overwrite flags or generated default credentials. Requests are not logged in
full.

These are source-level and testable boundaries. Review the generated project,
its dependencies and its runtime configuration before using it for a real
service.

## Releases

Release tags use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Release automation builds from the
exact tag, emits SHA-256 checksums, produces a CycloneDX SBOM and publishes a
GitHub build-provenance attestation where the repository settings support it.
Those assets prove how the tagged source was built; a GitHub Release does not
prove production deployment, customer delivery or traffic cutover.
