# Changelog

All notable public changes to this project are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and releases
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.0] - Unreleased

> Candidate notes for the next release; this version is not public until its
> tag, CI, assets, and release gates are independently verified.

### Added

- Renamed the repository to `Icarus-harness-java-scaffold` and converged its
  positioning on a Java architecture harness. Existing Maven coordinates,
  Java namespaces, CLI options and REST routes remain compatible.
- Both profiles now generate an architecture source/test reference map, one
  durable scope/answer/task record and a standard-library local verifier.
  Preflight blocks dependent build work while a necessary answer is missing;
  source/build, runtime, acceptance and release evidence remain distinct.
- Added append-only local evidence recording with task digest and Git identity;
  passing a build never automatically marks task steps complete.

- Added a trusted-classpath `TemplatePack` SPI with safe logical
  `TemplateDefinition` paths and an immutable registry; the stock registry
  contains only the bundled `default` pack.
- Added `--template-pack` to the CLI and `templatePack` to REST requests while
  preserving `default` output for requests that omit the field.
- Added the REST `icarus.scaffold.allowed-template-packs` allow-list, defaulting
  to `default`, with comma-separated environment configuration and fail-closed
  rejection for disallowed or unknown IDs.
- Added deterministic `simple` and `modular` architecture profiles to the CLI,
  REST request and bundled `default` pack. Omitting `profile` keeps the existing
  five-module `modular` output; `simple` keeps the greeting and health slice in
  one Maven module.
- Documented the CLI as a reproducible no-AI entry point. Natural-language
  interpretation remains the responsibility of a separate host tool.
- Documented generated root `AGENTS.md` as the stock project guide and explain
  when a later module-level AI guide is justified instead of duplicating rules
  for every generated module.

### Security

- Kept template selection closed to template directories, arbitrary filesystem
  paths, URLs, shell commands and runtime external JAR paths; duplicate and
  unsafe pack manifests are rejected.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-28

> Public release verified for `v1.1.4` while preparing the 1.2.0 candidate.

### Fixed

- Stopped generated projects from inheriting an Icarus copyright or LICENSE by
  default; a LICENSE is now emitted only when the caller supplies a supported
  license, rights holder, and year as one complete decision.
- Added validated Apache-2.0 and MIT rendering across the core, CLI and REST
  adapters, including negative tests for partial or unsupported license input.

### Changed

- Reworked the bilingual first-glance description around a consistent,
  reviewable, buildable and testable Java service starting point.
- Replaced hard-coded latest-version claims with dynamic GitHub Release facts
  and added an illustrative generated project tree and runnable API result.
- Added the reusable Governance release-documentation gate, pinned to the
  reviewed `main` commit SHA, before release packaging.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-26

> Public release verified for `v1.1.3` while preparing the 1.2.0 candidate.

### Fixed

- Terminate timed-out Docker/Compose process trees on Windows so Buildx cannot
  keep the generated temporary directory locked after a failed verification.
- Allow a 600-second cold-cache Docker build window by default, with a positive
  `ICARUS_DOCKER_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` override for slower or faster runners.
- Reworked the English and Chinese READMEs around a core-feature table, common
  use cases and a four-step first-project path so new users can reach a useful
  generated sample without reconstructing the workflow from scattered sections.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Added a first-glance bilingual value proposition and a concrete new-service generation scenario.
- Added companion links to AI-first Vibe Coding Skill and Icarus Open-source Governance.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Generated projects now honor the requested application port during direct `java -jar` startup; the sample verifier exercises that generated default instead of overriding it on the command line.
- Generated-sample cleanup now uses a unique Compose project name and removes only its own local images, temporary containers, networks, and verification directory.
- Recorded the theme-compatible watermark and published-release wording changes that are present on `main` but not in the immutable `v1.1.0` tag.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-26

The productization release adds:

- a cwd-confined `--output <filename.zip>` CLI option with no-overwrite,
  race-safe `CREATE_NEW` semantics while preserving stdout as the default;
- generated-sample package, bounded health/greeting runtime checks and optional
  Docker Compose capability checks with explicit `NOT_RUN` when Docker is not
  available;
- a JRE-only generated container health probe, public LICENSE/SUPPORT files,
  and bilingual quick-start and troubleshooting documentation;
- local public brand asset copies and version-aligned release documentation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-25

Initial public release line:

- security-focused Spring project generation with validated coordinates and
  confined template paths;
- core, CLI and optional server boundaries;
- generated-project tests and repository-level sample-build verification;
- bilingual documentation and public contribution/security guidance;
- GitHub CI, dependency automation, static security analysis, checksums, SBOM
  and build-provenance release metadata.
